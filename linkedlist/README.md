# linkedlist

This is an implementation of a singly linked list of integers. Includes functionality to insert and find
elements, as well as to sort the list and generate string representation. In the future, it will include
the ability to delete, as well as implementations of various functions to solve algorithmic problems relating
to linked lists (e.g., determining whether the list has a cycle).
