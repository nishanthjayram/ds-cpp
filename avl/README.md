# avl

This is an implementation of a balanced binary search tree using the AVL algorithm. Specifically, this AVL tree is
designed to store string data, but may be modified in the future to incorporate template classes.

Currently contains methods to insert and perform range queries (accomplished efficiently by storing subtree sizes).
Also contains function for printing a preorder traversal of the tree. The goal is to implement delete and other
notable AVL functions in the future.
